# Option 3

## These are some added features that I would like to have present on the final project:

**1. Non-repeat dates**

- Dates will not be repeated until all the dates in potentialDates[] array are used up.
- There will be the ability to add new dates to potentialDates[] before all the dates are used up.
- The user will be able to see all the dates that have been done/are left to do.

**2. Ability to rate dates**

- When returning to the application, the user will be able to 'updoot' or 'downdoot' the date that was selected before.
- The user will be able to see the dates that have been completed and that are left.

**3. When the potential dates array empties**

- When all of the dates are used up in potentialDates[], an alert will pop up to alert the user that there are no more dates left.
- The user will be able to review the list of 'updooted' and 'downdooted' dates.
- User can either manually add into the next pool of future dates or they can just generate the next pool based on the updooted dates.
